Subject: [Alba-experiment-devel] Gentoo/OpenSolaris (aka the alba experiment)
Message-ID: <46804FC5.5070308@schinagl.nl>

Hello,

I just stumbled uppon the alba experiment as I was looking whether
gentoo had an alt project (like Gentoo/FreeBSD etc,
www.*gentoo*.org/proj/en/*gentoo*-*alt*/) for OpenSolaris. Since
OpenSolaris is about to get GPL/Parts are GPLed and so.

The reason why I was looking for information on Gentoo/OpenSolaris is of
course, ZFS. ZFS-Fuse for my regular gentoo is slow and I don't quite
trust it yet. ZFS on Gentoo/FBSD isn't there yet, which I found out
after installing it. The last spot where I could (reliably) get ZFS from
would be opensolaris. Now though I'm a so called 'nerd' and don't mind
tinkering with stuff, I didn't really feel upto the challange to learn
yet a nother OS. The thought of having Gentoo/OpenSolaris however made
me change my mind though. Just emerging packages, and using the very
well known startup scripts etc etc that I know and love in gentoo would
make it a painless transition.

Since I want to run a pure storage server with OpenSolaris, my
requirements are quite low. A stable minimal bootable OS that can run
NFS, ZFS, maybe samba and FTP.

So my question basically are, Why is it called the alba experiment and
not Gentoo/OpenSolaris :p

Ok, the real question is, is alba up for the job of running a stable
opensolaris? And though the installation page on the wiki mentiones you
have to have it installed and running, i suppose I could simply boot an
opensolaris liveCD, mount the hdd, unpack stage1.5 and the portage tree
(like a regular gentoo installation), emerge -e system, reboot and done?
And, is it up to date? e.g. does it have the zfs stuff, are ebuilds
updated and such.

thanks for your time,

oliver
